# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | To share and use code in tandem with other developers. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | make a directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | pseudo classes are special properties given to an element. I would guess we would use them mainly for css; to show an alt tag while hovering over an image, for example. |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Specificity is used to define a specific sub part of an element. Instead of selecting the main element itself it selects something that comes after. Something more specific like the child of a parent element. Another example of specificity might be class selectors within the brackets of an element. 

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | If you use too many !important's you will accidentally override any preceding specificity already in place. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | selectors, properties, and values |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Accessibility for screen readers, easily legible (high  contrast for headers and backgrounds) Easy to navigate with big links and buttons. Spaced out ui  |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | Website Mock planning|

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Yes because it allows me to visualize everything I'm about to build without having to memorize anything 

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | displays code inline horizontally instead of vertically |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > |Width and Height |
